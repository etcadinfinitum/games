## Welcome to Lizzy's Game Depot

I will be adding games I make to this repository.

### Offerings

### Frequently Asked Questions

> Should you (Lizzy) be writing games?

Probably not. I have no more than 16 cumulative hours of gameplay in my entire life.

> Should I (reader) play these games?

I will get back to you on that.

> Do you have a favorite game to play?

I'm glad you asked; [psychadelic PacMan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV_jf2GyjkE) is historically the one I enjoy the most.

Also, [making paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html). (In case you doubted where my game development interests currently lie, this about sums it up.)

_Author's note: I would probably enjoy Portal...if I ever played it. :sob:_
